I am just a little Kangaroo
And I Like to play around and leave big footsteps on the ground
I am just a little Kangaroo 
If you really wnat to see me try and get a ride for free
you may come down under but make sure that you're alone
Kangaroos they are just like Thunder yes it's true 
Sure their way of living makes you happy and you see 
Well there's no other 'roo hopping just like me
Stand up come together sing along
I am just a little Kangaroo
And I Like to play around and leave big footsteps on the ground
I am just a little Kangaroo
If you really wnat to see me try and get a ride for free
Baby Kangaroo they just can wait to see the light 
So they crawl in mummys bag and look so bright
Emus Wombats Dingos Cacdoos and crocodiles
They all wander in the outback 1000 miles
Stand up come together sing along
I am just a little Kangaroo
And I Like to play around and leave big footsteps on the ground
I am just a little Kangaroo
If you really wnat to see me try and get a ride for free
If the truck is coming then I surely hop away
as I know I can not win this stupid game
Your imagination has to change so many things
So don't hide away but cry out loud today
Stand up come together sing along
I am just a little Kangaroo
And I Like to play around and leave big footsteps on the ground
I am just a little Kangaroo
If you really wnat to see me try and get a ride for free
